<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error is clear: The file `./examples/page-with-supabase.tsx` is trying to import `MapboxMap` from `../components/MapboxMap`, but it can't find it.

Looking at the project structure:
- The file `examples/page-with-supabase.tsx` is at the root of the project in the `examples/` directory
- The `MapboxMap.tsx` component is in `app/components/MapboxMap.tsx`

So from `examples/page-with-supabase.tsx`, the relative path `../components/MapboxMap` would look for a `components` folder at the root level, but it's actually at `app/components/MapboxMap`.

The correct import path should be `../app/components/MapboxMap`.

Let me first read the file to see the current state and then fix it.</details></think>

I'll help you resolve this import error. The issue is that the import path in `examples/page-with-supabase.tsx` is incorrect. Let me check the file and fix it.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: examples/page-with-supabase.tsx

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The issue is on line 4 where it's importing MapboxMap from `../components/MapboxMap`, but based on the project structure, the MapboxMap component is located at `app/components/MapboxMap.tsx`.

Since the file `examples/page-with-supabase.tsx` is in the `examples/` directory at the root level, the correct relative path should be `../app/components/MapboxMap`.

I'll fix this import path.</details></think>

---

**Plan:**
The import path is incorrect. The `MapboxMap` component is in `app/components/`, but the import is looking for it in `components/` relative to the `examples/` directory.

Tool use: **search_replace**

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've fixed the import path. Now let me check if there are any linter errors with this file to make sure the fix is correct.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! The fix is complete and there are no linter errors. The issue was that the import path was relative to the examples directory, and it needed to include the `app/` folder in the path to reach the MapboxMap component.</details></think>

---

**Steps taken:**
1. Fixed the import path in `examples/page-with-supabase.tsx` from `../components/MapboxMap` to `../app/components/MapboxMap`
2. Verified no linter errors remain

The build should now succeed. The issue was that the import path didn't account for the `app/` directory structure where the `MapboxMap` component is actually located.
