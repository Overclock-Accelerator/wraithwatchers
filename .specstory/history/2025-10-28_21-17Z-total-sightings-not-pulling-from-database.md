<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that the total sightings count is not pulling from the database. Based on the screenshot, I can see a "Total Sightings: 1,000" display. The user has been working with Supabase based on the files they've been viewing.

Let me first look at the currently open file and the main page to understand what's happening with the sightings count.

I should:
1. Read the examples/page-with-supabase.tsx file (currently open)
2. Read the main app/page.tsx file 
3. Check how the total sightings is being fetched

Let me start by reading these files to understand the current implementation.</details></think>

I'll check how the total sightings count is currently being fetched and displayed.
